Opening Links in a New Window
-----------------------------
One feature available with hyperlinks is the ability to determine where a link opens when clicked. 
Typically, links open in the same window from which they are clicked; however, links may also be opened in new windows.

To trigger the action of opening a link in a new window, use the target attribute with a value of _blank. 
The target attribute determines exactly where the link will be displayed, and the _blank value specifies a new window.

Linking to Parts of the Same Page
----------------------------------
Periodically we’ll see hyperlinks that link to part of the same page the link appears on. 
A common example of these same-page links are “Back to top” links that return a user to the top of a page.

We can create an on-page link by first setting an id attribute on the element we wish to link to, 
then using the value of that id attribute within an anchor element’s href attribute.

Using the “Back to top” link as an example, we can place an id attribute value of top on the <body> element. 
Now we can create an anchor element with an href attribute value of #top, pound sign and all, 
to link to the beginning of the <body> element.

Our code for this same-page link would look like the following:

<body id="top">
  ...
  <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
  ...
</body>


Creating Lists
======================
When we want to use a list on a website, HTML provides three different types to choose from: 
unordered, ordered, and description lists. 
Choosing which type of list to use—or whether to use a list at all—comes down to the content 
and the most semantically appropriate option for displaying that content.

Unordered Lists
----------------
An unordered list is simply a list of related items whose order does not matter.
 Creating an unordered list in HTML is accomplished using the unordered list block-level element, <ul>. 
Each item within an unordered list is individually marked up using the list item element, <li>.

By default, most browsers add a vertical margin and left padding to the <ul> element and precede each <li> element with a (solid) dot. 
This solid dot is called the list item marker, and it can be changed using CSS.

<ul>
  <li>Orange</li>
  <li>Green</li>
  <li>Blue</li>
</ul>

Ordered Lists
--------------
The main difference between an ordered list and an unordered list is that with an ordered list, 
the order in which items are presented is important.

Start Attribute
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=----
The start attribute defines the number from which an ordered list should start.

<ol start="30">
  <li>Head north on N Halsted St</li>
  <li>Turn right on W Diversey Pkwy</li>
  <li>Turn left on N Orchard St</li>
</ol>

Reversed Attribute
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
The reversed attribute, when used on the <ol> element, allows a list to appear in reverse order.
An ordered list of five items numbered 1 to 5 may be reversed and ordered from 5 to 1.
<ol reversed>
  <li>Head north on N Halsted St</li>
  <li>Turn right on W Diversey Pkwy</li>
  <li>Turn left on N Orchard St</li>
</ol>

Value Attribute
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
The value attribute may be used on an individual <li> element within an ordered list to change its value within the list.

<ol>
  <li>Head north on N Halsted St</li>
  <li vallue="9">Turn right on W Diversey Pkwy</li>
  <li>Turn left on N Orchard St</li>	<!-- This then becomes number 10-->
</ol>

Description Lists
------------------------
When adding a description list, the <dt> element must come before the <dd> element. 
The definition term and the description that directly follows it correspond to one another; 
thus, the order of these elements is important.

<dl>
  <dt>study</dt>
  <dd>The devotion of time and attention to acquiring knowledge on an academic subject, especially by means of books</dd>
  <dt>design</dt>
  <dd>A plan or drawing produced to show the look and function or workings of a building, garment, 
		or other object before it is built or made</dd>
  <dd>Purpose, planning, or intention that exists or is thought to exist behind an action, fact, or material object</dd>
  <dt>business</dt>
  <dt>work</dt>
  <dd>A person's regular occupation, profession, or trade</dd>
</dl>

Nesting Lists
----------------------
One trick with nesting lists is to know where to begin and end each list and list item. 
Speaking specifically about unordered and ordered lists, as that is where most nesting will occur, 
the only element that may reside directly within the <ul> and <ol> elements is the <li> element. 
To repeat, the only element we can place as a direct child of the <ul> and <ol> elements is the <li> element.

<ol>
  <li>Walk the dog</li>
  <li>Fold laundry</li>	<!-- occurs with numbers -->
  <li>
    Go to the grocery and buy:
    <ul>
      <li>Milk</li>	<!-- occurs with (hollow) dot -->
      <li>Bread</li>
      <li>Cheese</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Mow the lawn</li>
  <li>Make dinner</li>
</ol>

Adding Images
======================
To add images to a page, we use the <img> inline element. 
The <img> element is a self-containing, or empty, element, which means that it doesn’t wrap 
any other content and it exists as a single tag.
{NOTE:  We most commonly see jpg images used for photographs and png images used for icons or background patterns}

<img src="dog.jpg" alt="A black, brown, and white dog wearing a kerchief">
