**My First Java EarthQuake Applet**
---
- Coursera, UCSD Java Object Oriented Programming
- Designed the applet to take data from RSS Feed and plot the earth-quakes on the world map
- Distinguish between Land and Ocean Earthquake while plotting and locate the places which could be within the threat area of an Earthquake
- Also enhanced the applet to show various statistical data related to the earthquake
